# Privacy Policy for ∞Dictation (Endless Dictation)

**Effective Date:** February 11, 2026

Thank you for choosing ∞Dictation (also known as Endless Dictation / ∞听写 / ∞文字起こし). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. 

This Privacy Policy explains what information our application collects, how it is used, and how it is shared. **Please read this policy carefully.**

## 1. Our "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) Model
∞Dictation operates strictly as a local client application. We utilize a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture. This means the app does not rely on our own backend AI servers. Instead, it requires you to input your personal OpenAI API Key to function. 

**Because of this architecture, we (the Developers) DO NOT collect, store, intercept, or have any access to your personal data, API keys, or voice recordings.**

## 2. What Data Is Sent and To Whom?
To provide you with voice-to-text transcription and summarization features, the app must process your voice data. 

* **What data is sent:** Your voice recordings (audio files) and the resulting transcribed text.
* **Who the data is sent to:** The data is transmitted **directly** from your device to **OpenAI, L.L.C.** via their official API. 
* **API Key Storage:** Your personal OpenAI API Key is stored securely and locally on your device's Keychain. It is never transmitted to the developer or any third party other than OpenAI directly.

## 3. Third-Party Data Protection (OpenAI)
When you use ∞Dictation, your audio and text data are subject to OpenAI’s privacy and data usage policies. 

We confirm that our integration relies entirely on OpenAI's enterprise-grade API services. According to OpenAI's official API data usage policies, data sent via their API is **not** used to train their generative AI models by default. 

OpenAI provides data protection standards that are equal to or stricter than those outlined in this policy. For more detailed information on how OpenAI handles your data, please review the [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

## 4. User Consent
We require your explicit permission before sending any of your personal data to OpenAI. 
Upon entering your API Key in the app for the first time, you will be presented with a clear disclosure statement. You must actively consent to the transmission of your voice/text data to OpenAI before you can use the transcription and summarization features.

## 5. Data Retention
Because we do not collect or store your data on any external servers managed by us, we do not have a data retention policy for user data. All your transcriptions, audio files, and API keys remain strictly on your local device. If you delete the app, this local data will be removed from your device.
